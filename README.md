# Lazy Image Loading

This repo demonstrates how you can use Intersection Observer along with the `onLoad` event to load images as needed, in Svelte.

To run, clone this repo then:

```
cd svelte-image-loading
npm install
npm run dev
```

It should then be available to view on `https://localhost:5000`.
